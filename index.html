        <h2>Why Women in Tech?</h2>
        <p>I want to be part of Women in Tech because I believe diversity drives innovation. I see the lack of female representation in tech spaces, which sparked my desire to break those barriers. By joining a community like this, I believe I will be able to amplify women's voices and empower them in technology, by creating solutions that are more inclusive and impactful. I want to contribute to a community that helps build a future where women are no longer an exception, but a norm in tech.</p>

        <h2>How I Plan To Contribute</h2>
        <p>I plan to contribute by organizing hands-on workshops and hackathons that focus on building practical skills while promoting collaboration among women in tech. I also want to create a mentorship program that pairs experienced women in the industry with students to guide them through career and personal growth. By fostering a strong, supportive community, I hope to inspire confidence and push the boundaries of what women can achieve in tech, both on and off campus.</p>
